# matroids
Python implementation of the class matroid

Implementation based on the ground set and independent subsets definition of matroid stated in "Matroid theory" by James G. Oxley.

Dependencies: sympy, rustworkx
Optional dependencies: graphviz (for the drawLattice method of the AbstractMatroid class)

The main file for the program is matroids.py. It implements the class AbstractMatroid and contains two functions starMatroid and unifromMatroid which return matroids of special interest.
